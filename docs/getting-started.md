Start-InvokeHub -ApiUrl $api -ApiKey "YOUR-KEY"

# Navigate to your script and execute
```

### Use in automation
```powershell
# Download a script directly (if you know the path)
$headers = @{ "X-API-Key" = "YOUR-KEY" }
$script = Invoke-RestMethod `
    -Uri "https://your-api/script?path=Utilities/Get-SystemInfo.ps1" `
    -Headers $headers

# Execute it
Invoke-Expression $script.content
```

### Create an alias

function hub {
    irm "https://your-invokehub.azurewebsites.net/api/loader?key=YOUR-KEY" | iex
}

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Review before executing**: Always check script content (option 3) before running
2. **Know your scripts**: Only run scripts from trusted sources
3. **Check the hash**: Verify script hash when prompted
4. **Use least privilege**: Don't run PowerShell as admin unless necessary

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### InvokeHub won't start
```powershell
# Enable TLS 1.2
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

# Check PowerShell version
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion  # Should be 5.1+
```

### Authentication errors
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check for extra spaces or quotes
- Ensure internet connectivity

### Scripts not showing
- Contact your administrator
- Scripts may not be uploaded yet
- Check if you have the correct API endpoint
